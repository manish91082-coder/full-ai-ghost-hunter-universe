**G01 DEX Source Materialization + Filter Correction**

- Observed and verified successful GitHub Actions execution.
- Detected live-source category spelling Dexs that was absent from the extractor filter.
- Corrected extractor and CI materializer and reran successfully.
- Materialized 8,315 source protocol rows, 2,106 DEX-category rows, 3,346 unique protocol×chain observations and 419 unique chain labels.
- 36 labels overlap the current G01 union at name level; 383 labels remain unmatched and require semantic verification.
- Preserved raw payload hash and workflow artifact metadata.
- G01 remains ACTIVE / NOT SATURATED; live execution STOP.
- Next: semantic reconciliation and primary identity/lifecycle verification of the observed DEX chain surface.
